# IN-BIOS5000 / IN-BIOS9000 Autumn 2024

## Sequencing technologies, data analysis and applications

The information below is preliminary and will be updated. In particular, the exact dates are uncertain.


## Introduction

Here you will find information about the autumn 2024 edition of the credited courses [**IN-BIOS5000**](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN-BIOS5000) (MSc level) and [**IN-BIOS9000**](http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN-BIOS9000) (PhD level), on Sequencing technologies, data analysis and applications.
The course is offered by the Department of Informatics and the Department of Biosciences at the University of Oslo (UiO) in collaboration with contributors from Oslo University Hospital and the Norwegian Veterinary Institute.
It is partially funded by the [**NORBIS, the national research school in bioinformatics, biostatistics and systems biology**](https://norbis.w.uib.no/genome-sequencing-technologies-assembly-variant-calling-and-statistical-genomics-2/).
This course consists of two weeks of lectures and practicals, a home project with an oral exam presentation, and a digital written exam.


## Audience

The course is open for master and PhD students at UiO, as well as to PhD students registered through the NORBIS national research school. To earn credits for the course, PhD students from other institutions than UiO must obtain the status as a [visiting PhD candidate](https://www.mn.uio.no/english/research/phd/educational-component/visiting-phd.html) at the UiO Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. Applications may be submitted starting 14 June 2024 and must be submitted by 1 August 2024. A maximum of 30 students in total will be admitted to the course.


## Course content

The course provides knowledge of sequencing technologies and hands-on experience with the analysis of data from several current sequencing platforms and for various biological and medical applications. Tools, algorithms, and statistical methods for data analysis will be included, as well as data quality assessment and analysis reproducibility. The applications that will be covered may vary from year to year but will typically include de novo whole-genome assembly and variant calling. Other applications like RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, or metagenomics could also be covered.


## Learning outcome

After completing this course, you will:

* understand the differences, benefits, and drawbacks of the current sequencing technologies, and be able to decide which platform to use in what way for the different applications
* be able to evaluate sequencing data quality and quantity
* know the tools, algorithms, and statistical methods involved in the data analysis
* be able to perform bioinformatics analysis with data tailored towards selected applications
* be able to report on the data analysis in such a way that the methods used and the steps taken are transparent, thus enhancing reproducibility
* be aware of, and know to deal with, the ethical and data-sensitivity issues surrounding sequencing data derived from human subjects
* be able to critically evaluate, validate and judge the results of bioinformatics analysis of sequencing experiments in terms of underlying assumptions, reliability, sensitivity and specificity, and evaluate their value for answering biological questions


## Location

The course will be held at the UiO campus, in seminar room 2269 *Python* (**not confirmed**), on floor 2 in the northern end of
[Ole-Johan Dahl's building](https://www.uio.no/english/about/getting-around/areas/gaustad/ga06/), Gaustadalléen 23B, Oslo.

## Contact information

* Torbjørn Rognes (Course coordinator), email torognes@ifi.uio.no


## Meals

Coffee and tea will be freely available each morning in the seminar room.

For lunch, we recommend the canteen in the other end of the building, [Ole-Johan eatery](https://www.sio.no/en/food-and-beverage/spisesteder/ole-johan-eatery), which serves a nice selection of warm and cold dishes.

We are organizing a free dinner for all course participants at a restaurant some day during the course.

We will also order pizza one afternoon.


## Requirements

* We recommend that participants should have a basic understanding of molecular biology as provided by an introductory course in bioinformatics, molecular biology, or genetics.

* No formal background in computer science is required, however, students must have a basic understanding of the unix shell. Students should take an introductory unix course beforehand if they do not have these skills.


## Computing facilities

All students must have a laptop with either Windows (version 10 or more recent), macOS, Linux or other Unix operating system. You need to be able to access the Eduroam wifi network. If you do not have a UiO or Eduroam account, a temporary Wifi account may be created for you. We advise you to bring an external mouse, and do not rely on touchpad/trackpad only.

The course will use computational resources on the Educloud Fox system at UiO. [Access to Educloud](Educloud/index.md) will be provided for all course participants. A [list of the software packages](software.md) that will be used is available.

If you are struggling with anything of the above, you must contact the course coordinator (see contact details on this page) as soon as possible, and at least one week before the start of the course.


## Curriculum and suggested reading
 
The curriculum consists of a set of scientific articles. The exam will contain questions on the material presented in these papers on the material covered during the course. Specific details of the curriculum, and a list of further suggested papers, can be found [here](Curriculum/index.md).


## Exam

The exam will be a combination of the following two parts:

 * an *individual* home project combined with an oral exam presentation of the home project followed by questioning / discussion on December 12th and 13th (not confirmed). Students will present their work to 2-3 teachers, followed by some questioning (approx 20 minutes in total for each student). This home exam will be handed out to all participants after the lectures.
 * a 2 hour written digital exam at Silurveien 2 on December 12th or 13th (date not confirmed)

The exams are graded on a pass/fail scale.

Written exams from previous years:

* [2018](https://github.com/arvindsundaram/IN-BIOSx000/blob/2018/misc/written_exam.pdf)
* [2016](https://github.com/lexnederbragt/INF-BIOx121/blob/2017/misc/2016.pdf) (exam only)
* [2015](https://github.com/lexnederbragt/INF-BIOx121/tree/2015/exam) (with information on how the grading was done)
* [2014](https://wiki.uio.no/projects/clsi/images/f/f2/Examinfbio2014.pdf) (exam only)

There was no written exam in 2020 due to the pandemic.
